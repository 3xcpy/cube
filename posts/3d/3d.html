                <h2>How it's made</h2>
                <p>
                    This site is made using three.js and plain HTML & CSS in a few hours. It's a proof of concept for 3D technology on the web. With more and more websites using 3D, it's important to understand how to use it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are a lot of resources on how to make a website like this. I used <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7AOvWpIVHU?si=FUJ3nZcZGmmMr7y_">a tutorial by the YouTuber Fireship</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's not that difficult to make a website like this. You just need to know how to use three.js and how to use HTML & CSS. If you follow a tutorial and modify the result, you can make something original and unique.

            <section>
                <h2>Another text box!</h2>
                <p>
                    I don't know what to write here, but I need some text to have enough scrolling space. How this works is that the camera is moved back by the scrolling amount. The text is not 3D, just normal HTML & CSS. This is a very simple way to make a 3D website.

            <section class="left">
                <h2>More text!</h2>
                <p>
                    This box is aligned to the left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really don't know what to write here. I'm just trying to fill up space. I hope you don't mind.
